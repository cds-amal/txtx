# Doctor Command Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

1. **Basic Command Structure** ✅
   - Added `doctor` command to CLI with proper argument parsing
   - Supports validating all runbooks or a specific one
   - Pattern detection for common issues

2. **Pattern Detection for send_eth** ✅
   - Detects attempts to access non-existent outputs like:
     - `action.transfer.result.from`
     - `action.transfer.tx_hash.from`
     - `action.transfer.value`
   - Enhanced to catch `.tx_hash.` patterns per your feedback

3. **Error Reporting** ✅
   - Clear messages about what outputs are available
   - Location information (file and line number)
   - Factual suggestions (not incorrect ones)

## Current Limitations

1. **Not Using txtx-core Parser**
   - Uses simple pattern matching instead of proper AST parsing
   - Cannot understand the full structure of runbooks
   - May have false positives or miss some cases

2. **Not Integrated with Addon System**
   - Doesn't know what outputs each action actually provides
   - Can only check for known patterns (like send_eth)
   - Cannot validate inputs or other action types

3. **Simple YAML Parsing**
   - Basic pattern matching for manifest files
   - May not handle all YAML formats correctly

4. **Output Issues**
   - The CLI seems to be suppressing output in some cases
   - Logging infrastructure may be interfering

## What Doctor SHOULD Do (With Proper Integration)

```rust
// Use the actual parser
let runbook = parse_runbook(content)?;

// Get action specifications from addons
let addon = get_addon("evm");
let send_eth_spec = addon.get_command("send_eth");

// Validate each action output reference
for action in runbook.actions {
    for output_ref in find_references(&action) {
        if !send_eth_spec.outputs.contains(&output_ref.field) {
            report_error(
                "Action '{}' only provides outputs: {}",
                action.name,
                send_eth_spec.outputs.keys().join(", ")
            );
        }
    }
}
```

## Key Takeaway

The doctor command demonstrates what's possible, but needs proper integration with:
- txtx-parser for AST-based analysis
- Addon system for knowing actual action specifications
- Same validation logic as runtime

Without this integration, it can only do pattern matching which is fragile and can give incorrect advice (like suggesting non-existent `get_transaction` action).

## The send_eth Issue

Your specific issue was trying to access fields that don't exist on `send_eth`:
- ❌ `action.transfer.result.from`
- ❌ `action.transfer.tx_hash.from`
- ✅ `action.transfer.tx_hash` (only this is valid)

The doctor command would catch these with proper integration and tell you:
"The 'evm::send_eth' action only outputs 'tx_hash' (string)"

No incorrect suggestions about using `get_transaction` (which doesn't exist)!
