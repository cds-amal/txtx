## deploy_subgraph {{ tag: 'action' }}

`svm::deploy_subgraph` creates a live Graph QL database for your program.

This command takes a program ID to index, a block height to start indexing from, and a set of events to index.
This data is encoded as a request and sent to your surfnet (when deploying to localhost) or to the Surfpool cloud services (when deploying to devnet or mainnet).

  <Property name="clone_program_account" required="optional" type="map">
    The program clone data to set. This is a map type containing the keys:
  - **source_program_id**: The public key of the program to clone.
  - **destination_program_id**: The destination public key of the program.
  </Property>


  <Property name="pre_condition" required="optional" type="map">
    Pre-conditions are assertions that are evaluated before a command is executed. They can be used to determine if the command should be executed or if a specific behavior should be executed based on the result of the assertion. This is a map type containing the keys:
  - **behavior**: The behavior if the pre-condition assertion does not pass. Possible values are:
    - **halt** (default): Throws an error and halts execution of the runbook
    - **log**: Logs a warning and continues execution of the runbook
    - **skip**: Skips execution of this command and all downstream commands

  - **assertion**: The assertion to check to determine if the pre-condition behavior should be executed. This value should evaluate to a boolean, or the `std::assert_eq` and other assertions from the standard library can be used.
  </Property>


  <Property name="post_condition" required="optional" type="map">
    Post-conditions are assertions that are evaluated after a command is executed. They can be used to determine if the command should be re-executed or if a specific behavior should be executed based on the result of the assertion. This is a map type containing the keys:
  - **retries**: If the post-condition assertion fails, the number of times to re-execute the command before executing the post-condition behavior. The default is 0.

  - **backoff_ms**: If the post-condition assertion fails, the number of milliseconds to wait before re-executing the command.
If not specified, the default is 1000 milliseconds (1 second).

  - **behavior**: The behavior if the post-condition assertion does not pass. Possible values are:
    - **halt** (default): Throws an error and halts execution of the runbook
    - **log**: Logs a warning and continues execution of the runbook
    - **skip**: Skips execution of this command and all downstream commands
    - **continue**: Continues execution without any action

  - **assertion**: The assertion to check to determine if the command should be re-executed or if the post-condition behavior should be executed. This value should evaluate to a boolean, or the `std::assert_eq` and other assertions from the standard library can be used.
