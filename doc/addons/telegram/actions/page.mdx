# Telegram Notifications (alpha) Actions {{ id: "telegram-actions" }}



## send_message {{ tag: 'action' }}

The `telegram::send_message` ...

### Inputs

<Properties>


  <Property name="description" required="optional" type="string">
    A description of the call.
  </Property>


  <Property name="telegram_bot_api_token" required="required" type="string">
    Coming soon
  </Property>


  <Property name="telegram_chat_id" required="required" type="string">
    Coming soon
  </Property>


  <Property name="message" required="required" type="string">
    Message to send.
  </Property>


  <Property name="pre_condition" required="optional" type="map">
    Pre-conditions are assertions that are evaluated before a command is executed. They can be used to determine if the command should be executed or if a specific behavior should be executed based on the result of the assertion. This is a map type containing the keys:
  - **behavior**: The behavior if the pre-condition assertion does not pass. Possible values are:
    - **halt** (default): Throws an error and halts execution of the runbook
    - **log**: Logs a warning and continues execution of the runbook
    - **skip**: Skips execution of this command and all downstream commands

  - **assertion**: The assertion to check to determine if the pre-condition behavior should be executed. This value should evaluate to a boolean, or the `std::assert_eq` and other assertions from the standard library can be used.
  </Property>


  <Property name="post_condition" required="optional" type="map">
    Post-conditions are assertions that are evaluated after a command is executed. They can be used to determine if the command should be re-executed or if a specific behavior should be executed based on the result of the assertion. This is a map type containing the keys:
  - **retries**: If the post-condition assertion fails, the number of times to re-execute the command before executing the post-condition behavior. The default is 0.

  - **backoff_ms**: If the post-condition assertion fails, the number of milliseconds to wait before re-executing the command.
If not specified, the default is 1000 milliseconds (1 second).

  - **behavior**: The behavior if the post-condition assertion does not pass. Possible values are:
    - **halt** (default): Throws an error and halts execution of the runbook
    - **log**: Logs a warning and continues execution of the runbook
    - **skip**: Skips execution of this command and all downstream commands
    - **continue**: Continues execution without any action

  - **assertion**: The assertion to check to determine if the command should be re-executed or if the post-condition behavior should be executed. This value should evaluate to a boolean, or the `std::assert_eq` and other assertions from the standard library can be used.
